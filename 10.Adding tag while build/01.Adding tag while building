1 st way to tag img while building
$ docker build -t image_name:001 .

to check the tag name
$ docker images   
you can able to see the img will be same with 2 different tag if that img already exits

if need to remove the image via specifying tag
$ docker image remove image_name:001 


2 nd way to tag an img after building img:
$ docker build tag image_name:001  image_name:new_tag_after_building_img


Pointing the latest tag to the new/latest img, since latest would be pointing to oldest img
$ docker image tag <img_id> <tag_name>:latest
